# SQL-Projects

Hi! Welcome to my SQL Projects repository.

Here, you'll find a collection of SQL projectsâ€”fun, interesting, and sometimes challenging. Each project is designed to solve real-world problems, explore datasets, and demonstrate key SQL skills and techniques.  

The projects range from beginner to advanced levels, covering concepts such as joins, aggregations, window functions, and more.  





Stay tuned for more projects as I continue to explore and share my SQL journey!
