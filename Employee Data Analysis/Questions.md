 ### Questions
 
In this project, we analyze an employee dataset to explore various aspects such as gender, salary, age distribution, and more. The dataset includes information like employee gender, salary, job title, department, and other factors.

Below are the questions we will answer by analyzing the dataset:
1. Distribution by Race/Ethnicity:
   - What is the racial/ethnic composition of the workforce?
   - Are there any significant disparities in the representation of different racial/ethnic groups across departments or positions?
2. Gender Representation:
   - What is the gender distribution within the organization?
   - Are there any gender imbalances in certain departments or roles?
3. Employment Type Distribution:
   - What proportion of employees are full-time, part-time, or contract workers?
   - Are there differences in employment types across departments or positions?
4. Age Distribution:
   - What is the age distribution of employees within the organization?
   - Are there any age-related trends in job titles or salary levels?
5. Tenure Analysis:
   - What is the distribution of employee tenure (length of employment) within the organization?
   - Are there differences in tenure between different demographic groups or departments?
6. Salary Distribution:
   - What is the distribution of base salaries across the organization? (mean, mode, median)
   - Are there any outliers or anomalies in salary levels?
7. Salary Disparities:
   - Are there significant differences in salaries between different demographic groups (e.g., race, gender)?
   - Is there evidence of gender or racial pay gaps within the organization?
8. Salary by Department/Position:
   - What is the average salary within each department or position title?
   - Are there departments or roles that offer higher salaries compared to others?

In the dataset, the difference between Hire Date and Job Date are;
- Hire Date refers to the date when the employee was initially hired by the company.
- Job Date refers to the date when the employee started their current or most recent position within the company.
